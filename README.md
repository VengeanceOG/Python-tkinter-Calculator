## Steps to use:

Just download the calculator.exe file on your computer and launch it.

## Steps to customise using source code:
1. import calc calss object from calc.py into __main__.py

2. Now use different customisable attributes for the object and at last use calc.run() function.

### Note: all the attributes should be changed after creating the object and before using the run function.

## Some customisable attributes include:

- calc.title (str): title of your window.
- calc.icon-path (str): icon of the window. (use an ico file)
- calc.separating_line_img (Photoimage): a line to separate two different frames of the window. (leave None if you don't need it)
- calc.bg (str): backgroung color of your window.
- calc.height/calc.width (int): dimensions of your window.
- calc.resizable (bool): If you want the window to be resizable or not.
- calc.expression_color/calc.total_color (str): color of the displaying label texts.
- calc.expression_frame_height: height of your expression frame.

### Note: I won't reccomend you to customise button image as you would require exact dimesions of the image to fit perfectly in the button, but if you want to customise, the dimensions must be 74x74.
